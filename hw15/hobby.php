				I love to bake, but I usually save it for special occasions. Towards the end of a semester I like to make treats for my classmates to snack on while studying for finals.

				It's been a couple years since I last crocheted. I enjoyed doing it sinc it allowed me to focus on something and clear my mind. After one of the cats chewed up my last project I haven't been motivated to do anything big.

				Perler consists of putting a bunch of beads on a grid and melting them together to make an image. I like to make designs that look like different video game sprites, but they don't always come out right. I have melted them before for to long and ended up with mess. The last time I made something, it was of me and my boyfriend.

				Origami is a hobby I picked up back in middle school and is something I still do occasionaly. I like making small things like flowers and butterflies. I also enjoy doing larger pieces that require multiple pieces, that when put together can make something really cool.
